April 3rd 2016


    This program implements a ray tracer which calculates primary rays with ambient, diffuse 
    and specular lighting. A shadow ray is also casted from the point of intersection and if
    the point is in shadow it will only have ambient light.
    
    Included are 5 text files which showcase various aspects of the program.
    
    Make sure to try all of them especially snooker.txt!!!!
    
    To run:
        type make
        type ./a4 <filename>
